# NCTU_Hikari's Codebook

A collection of code that are useful in programming contests.

Since we're a new team, many algorithms/concepts are still being learned and will be added to the collection progressively.

## Templates

### Math
#### FFT Multiplication
Utilizes FFT(Fast Fourier Transform) to multiply two polynomials of degree n in O(nlog(n)) time

## Credits

- Codebook of other NCTU teams
    - We use modified versions of NCTU_Fox and NCTU_Tmprry's codebook tex files
